# Contributing to Schuberg Philis AGENTS.md

Welcome! This repository captures Schuberg Philis engineering best practices as agent-readable instructions. We're excited to share our practices with the broader community and welcome contributions that improve functionality, clarity, security, and operational excellence.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone** this repository
2. **Find an existing examples**
3. **Submit a pull request** following our guidelines below

## What We're Looking For

**High-impact contributions:**
- New AGENTS.md files for popular stacks and frameworks
- Improved security practices and operational guidance
- Clear introduction manuals
- Clearer, more testable instructions for agents

## Content Standards

### Writing Style
- **Imperative voice**: "Use Prettier" not "You should use Prettier"
- **Be explicit**: "Do X. Do not do Y." over vague recommendations
- **Be testable**: Include commands agents can verify
- **Short sentences**: Aim for clarity over cleverness

### Security Requirements
- **No secrets**: Use placeholders like `<API_KEY>` or `${SECRET_FROM_VAULT}`
- **Pin versions**: Specify minimum versions for tools and dependencies
- **Secure defaults**: Least privilege, scanners enabled, safe configurations
- **Document risks**: Call out security implications of choices

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Branch Naming
Use the pattern: `<type>/<short-description>`
- `feat/golang-gin-agents`
- `fix/terraform-modules-security`
- `docs/contributing-guidelines`

### Commit Messages
Follow Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>(scope): <description>

feat(catalog/python): add Django AGENTS.md with security defaults
fix(catalog/terraform): correct provider version pinning
docs(readme): clarify acceptance criteria examples
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, test, chore, refactor, perf, build, ci

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## What
Brief description of changes

## Why
Problem being solved or value being added

## How
Technical approach and key decisions

## Testing
- [ ] Commands in Setup Commands are tested
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data included

## Checklist
- [ ] Uses imperative, testable language
- [ ] Includes security best practices
- [ ] Links are valid and stable
- [ ] YAML front matter is complete
```

## Review Process

### What We Look For
- **Clarity**: Can an agent follow these instructions unambiguously?
- **Security**: Are defaults secure? Any missing security considerations?
- **Testability**: Are acceptance criteria objective and measurable?
- **Alignment**: Does this match the Schuberg Philis way of working?
- **Completeness**: Are all template sections addressed appropriately?

## Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
- **Be respectful** in discussions and feedback
- **Assume good intent** from contributors
- **Focus on technical merit** over personal preferences
- **Help newcomers** understand our standards

### Getting Help
