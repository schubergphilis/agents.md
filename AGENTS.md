# Agent System and Tag-Based Prompts

_Include this file in your agentic editor's context._

This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of different agent modes in our development system, and how they interact with the modular tag-based prompt system.

## Core Agent Modes

### 1. Developer Mode
**Primary Role**: Feature implementation and code development

**Core Capabilities**:
- Writes and modifies application code using project technology stack
- Implements user interfaces, controllers, and business logic
- Creates database migrations and schema definitions
- Follows TDD practices (test-first development)
- Handles authentication flows and route configuration

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Implement features from backlog items according to acceptance criteria
- Write comprehensive tests before implementing functionality
- Ensure code follows established project patterns and best practices
- Update implementation documentation when completing features
- Maintain code quality through proper error handling and validation

**Required Knowledge**:
- Project framework patterns and architecture (see prompts/config/tech_stack.md)
- Language fundamentals and architectural principles
- Database operations and schema management patterns
- UI development patterns and component architectures
- Testing patterns and frameworks

**Project Configuration**: See prompts/config/agent_workflows.md for project-specific specialization areas.

### 2. Reviewer Mode
**Primary Role**: Code review and quality assurance

**Core Capabilities**:
- Analyzes code for adherence to established patterns and conventions
- Identifies potential bugs, security issues, and performance problems
- Validates test coverage and quality
- Ensures documentation is updated appropriately
- Verifies that acceptance criteria are met

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Review all code changes before they are committed
- Validate that completion criteria are met (see project configuration)
- Ensure atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Verify that changes align with architectural decisions
- Check for proper error handling and edge case coverage

**Review Criteria**:
- All tests pass and provide adequate coverage
- Code follows established patterns and conventions
- Documentation is updated to reflect changes
- Security best practices are followed
- Performance implications are considered

### 3. Orchestrator Mode
**Primary Role**: Workflow coordination and task management

**Core Capabilities**:
- Prioritizes work from the backlog based on business value and dependencies
- Coordinates between different agent types
- Manages the development lifecycle and ensures process adherence
- Monitors project progress and identifies blockers
- Facilitates communication between agents

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintain the project priority system with current work order
- Assign work to appropriate agent types based on their capabilities
- Ensure the development workflow follows established principles
- Monitor for process improvements and system optimization opportunities
- Coordinate handoffs between development phases

**Decision-Making Authority**:
- Work prioritization and resource allocation
- Process adjustments and workflow improvements
- Escalation of blockers and dependency issues
- Integration of feedback loops and learning

### 4. Documentation Mode
**Primary Role**: Information architecture and knowledge management

**Core Capabilities**:
- Maintains accurate and up-to-date project documentation
- Synthesizes information from multiple sources
- Identifies documentation gaps and inconsistencies
- Creates clear, actionable documentation for different audiences
- Manages the information flow between different system components

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Keep progress tracking current with development status
- Update architectural decision records when significant choices are made
- Ensure consistency between documentation and actual implementation
- Create and maintain prompts for common development tasks
- Archive completed work and maintain historical context

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Standard Development Flow
1. **Developer** implements feature following way of working
2. **Reviewer** validates implementation against quality criteria
3. **Orchestrator** marks work complete and identifies next priority
4. **Documentation** updates relevant docs and logs progress

### Quality Gates
Each agent mode has specific quality gates that must be satisfied:

- **Developer**: All tests pass, feature meets acceptance criteria
- **Reviewer**: Code quality standards met, security validated
- **Documentation**: All relevant docs updated, progress logged
- **Orchestrator**: Work properly tracked, next priorities identified

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

All agent types must:
- Maintain appropriate version control
- Follow the established information architecture
- Contribute to the continuous improvement feedback loop
- Respect the single source of truth for prioritization

## Specialization Areas

### Technology Development
- Authentication and authorization patterns (see project configuration)
- Framework-specific features and capabilities
- Database design and data operations
- Testing strategies and patterns
- Performance optimization

### Code Quality
- Security best practices
- Error handling and resilience
- Performance monitoring
- Test coverage and quality
- Maintainability and readability

### Process Management
- Backlog prioritization
- Dependency management
- Risk identification
- Progress tracking
- Continuous improvement

## üéØ Comprehensive Prompt System Guide

### How to Use the Tag-Based Prompt System

**The prompt system is organized into a modular, tag-based architecture:**

#### Main Task Categories (Complete Workflows)
Use these for end-to-end work processes:
- **#feature_dev** ‚Üí `prompts/feature_dev.md` - Implement new features using TDD
- **#debug_bug** ‚Üí `prompts/debug_bug.md` - Systematically investigate and fix bugs  
- **#product_strategy** ‚Üí `prompts/product_strategy.md` - Plan product direction and prioritization
- **#test_author** ‚Üí `prompts/test_author.md` - Create comprehensive test coverage
- **#support_triage** ‚Üí `prompts/support_triage.md` - Process user feedback and issues
- **#code_orient** ‚Üí `prompts/code_orient.md` - Understand unfamiliar codebase structure
- **#env_setup** ‚Üí `prompts/env_setup.md` - Set up development environments
- **#quick_fix** ‚Üí `prompts/quick_fix.md` - Implement small, low-risk changes
- **#refactor** ‚Üí `prompts/refactor.md` - Improve code quality without changing behaviour
- **#incident_resp** ‚Üí `prompts/incident_resp.md` - Handle production incidents

#### Building Blocks (Composable Steps)
Use these for specific workflow steps:
- **#context_intake** ‚Üí `prompts/context_intake.md` - Gather requirements and understand work
- **#test_plan** ‚Üí `prompts/test_plan.md` - Design comprehensive test coverage
- **#write_tests** ‚Üí `prompts/write_tests.md` - Create tests following TDD principles
- **#impl_change** ‚Üí `prompts/impl_change.md` - Make code changes with quality safeguards
- **#run_all_tests** ‚Üí `prompts/run_all_tests.md` - Execute and validate test suite
- **#reproduce_bug** ‚Üí `prompts/reproduce_bug.md` - Create bug reproduction test cases
- **#isolate_cause** ‚Üí `prompts/isolate_cause.md` - Systematically find root causes
- **#route_task** ‚Üí `prompts/route_task.md` - Classify and route incoming work requests
- **#doc_update** ‚Üí `prompts/doc_update.md` - Update project documentation

### üîç Prompt Discovery and Usage

#### When User Includes Tags
1. **Identify Tags**: Look for `#tag` patterns in user requests
2. **Find Prompt Files**: Tags map directly to filenames: `#feature_dev` ‚Üí `prompts/feature_dev.md`
3. **Read Full Prompt**: Load the complete prompt content and follow its guidance
4. **Apply Configuration**: Reference `prompts/config/` files for project-specific customizations
3. **Recursively unfold**: Where more context is relevant, recursively read any prompt referenced by tag

#### When No Tags Present
1. **Apply Classification**: Use `#route_task` to classify the type of work
2. **Suggest Appropriate Tags**: Recommend relevant prompts based on work type
3. **Compose Workflow**: Chain multiple prompts if complex work is needed

#### Fallback Strategy When Prompt Not Found
1. **Check Similar Categories**: Look for related prompts that might cover the work
2. **Compose from Building Blocks**: Combine building block prompts to create workflow
3. **Use Generic Patterns**: Apply closest existing prompt with modifications
4. **Request Clarification**: Ask user to refine request or provide more specific category

### üìã Tag Composition Patterns

#### Sequential Composition (Pipeline)
```
"Apply #context_intake then #test_plan then #write_tests for user authentication"
```
‚Üí Chain building blocks in sequence for complex workflows

#### Conditional Composition (Routing)
```
"Use #route_task to determine if this needs #feature_dev or #debug_bug"
```
‚Üí Use routing to select appropriate main workflow

#### Configuration Integration
```
"Use #feature_dev with technology-specific patterns for real-time features"
```
‚Üí Apply main workflow with technology-specific configuration

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

The prompt system uses a **layered approach**: generic methodologies (`prompts/`) + project-specific configuration (`prompts/config/`) = contextualized guidance.

**Key Configuration Files**: `prompts/config/tech_stack.md`, `prompts/config/specification.md`, `prompts/config/workflows.md`, `prompts/quality_standards.md`

üìñ **See More**: Complete configuration documentation in [`prompts/README.md`](prompts/README.md#-configuration-override-system)

### üöÄ Usage Examples

#### Simple Usage
```
"Use #debug_bug to fix the calculation error"
```
‚Üí Applies complete debugging workflow with project configuration

#### Building Block Composition
```
"Apply #context_intake then #isolate_cause to understand this performance issue"
```
‚Üí Explicitly chains specific building blocks

#### Technology Integration
```
"Use #feature_dev with project-specific patterns to implement real-time features"
```
‚Üí Applies development workflow with technology-specific guidance

### üîó Prompt Network

**Complete workflow map**: See `prompts/prompt_network.md` for visual dependency mapping

**Cross-references**: Each prompt includes "Related Prompts" section showing:
- **Prerequisites**: What to use before this prompt
- **Complements**: What works alongside this prompt  
- **Follows**: What to use after this prompt
